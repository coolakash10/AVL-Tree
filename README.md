# AVL-Tree
This program gives total AVL Tree functionality.

It include insert and delete operation in AVL tree.
To do it there are 4 main cases we have to consider :
          1. left left   - needs ones right rotation
	        2. left right  - needs one left and one right rotation
	        3. right left  - needs one right and one left rotation
	        4. right right - needs one left rotation
          
All other operations like searching ,finding max or min are same as normal BST.
